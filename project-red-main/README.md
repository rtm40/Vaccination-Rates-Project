Our title is "How Has the Anti-Vaccination Movement Impacted the Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) Vaccination Rates in Schools Across the US?". 

For our final project, we investigated measles vaccination rates across the US, which were compiled from the Wall Street Journal. Our research question is: “What factors associated with the anti-vaccination movement have impacted the Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) vaccination rates across the US?” We are looking at factors such as political affiliations of states, regional location, types of school, and whether or not the state has both personal and religious exemptions. After conducting data analsyis, we found that political affiliation of each state a school resides in and whether or not the state has religious and personal exemptions are the factors that have a suggestive impact on MMR vaccination rates in schools across the US.
